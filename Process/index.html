                    We work with what you've got (and help guide you if that's very little). Lucent serves to refresh your brand and rekindle the passion without losing your core identity and original vision. We specialise in creating optimized websites, and have a love for aesthetically-pleasing designs. 
                    <br><br>
                    This means that not only will you have a beautiful website, but it'll be easy to find in natural web browsing, perform cleanly and seamlessly (that means fast load times, too), and is intuitively constructed allowing for ease of use.
                    <br><br>
                    We also offer branding refreshes, so that you have an eye-catching logo to go along with your shiny new website.
